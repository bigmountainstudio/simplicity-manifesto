## The Simplicity Manifesto
*Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.*

This is a statement against over-engineered, over complicated code. It is a statement of belief that all code should be made as simple as possible as long as possible.

1. Code should stay as simple as possible for as long as possible.
2. Code is run by computers, but written for people.
