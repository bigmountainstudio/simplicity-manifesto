## The Simplicity Manifesto
*Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.*

This is a statement against over-engineered, over complicated code. It is a statement of belief that all code should be made as simple as possible as long as possible.

1. Code should stay as simple as possible for as long as possible.
1. Code is run by computers, but written for people.
1. If it cannot easily be learned or taught or is confusing, it probably shouldn't be used.
1. Before implementing the first solution found, research simpler solutions.
1. If no simple solutions exist, contact the creators of the technology and ask for a simpler solution.
1. If you have to diagram it, it might be too complex
1. If you can simplify another's solution, do so.
1. If you are too afraid to make a change, the code might be too complex.
1. If a feature requires an overly complex solution, seek to simplify the feature.
